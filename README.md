# OptiMatch
Stable Match

Takes an input from the user and creates a random dataset of n men and women
Sets the random preferences of each and runs the Gale-Shapley-Algorithm of Stable Matching

A Stable MAtching Problem states that given N men and N women, where each person has ranked all members of the opposite sex in order of preference,
marry the men and women together such that there are no two people of opposite sex who would both rather have each other than their current partners. 
If there are no such people, all the marriages are “stable”
